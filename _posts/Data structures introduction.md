### Abstract Data Type
> is an abstraction of a data structure which **provides only the interface** to which a data structure must adhere to.
> The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.



Abstraction(ADT) | Implementation (DS) 
-------- | ---------
List | Dynamic Array, Linked List
Queue | Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue
Map | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table
Vehicle | Golf cart, Bicycle, Smart car

### Big-O Notation
> gives an upper bound of the complexity in the **worst** case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes **arbitrararily large**

Time | Complexities
--------|---------
Constant Time | O($1$)
Logarithmic Time | O($log(n)$)
Linear Time | O($n$)
Linearithmic | O($nlog(n)$)
Quadric Time | O($n^2$)
Cubic Time | O($n^3$)
Exponential Time | O($b^n$)
Factorial Time | O($n!$)
